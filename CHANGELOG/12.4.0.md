- much more correct and consistent behavior for date functions on MongoDB
    - much of date_part was just plain wrong in map-reduce
    - implement `epoch` in map-reduce
    - correct decade, century, and millennium to be integers and mostly the right ones
- fix `TIME_OF_DAY` when running in map-reduce
- implement `POWER` on MongoDB (requiring map-reduce for now)
- alternative syntax, e.g. `DATE_PART("year", ts)` is now equivalent to `EXTRACT_YEAR(ts)`
- fairly complete tests for `math`, `relations`, and `date` libraries
- move compilation for MongoDB map-reduce out to a common `JsFuncHandler`, reducing duplication betweeen the two planners
