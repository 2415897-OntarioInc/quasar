* The `as` keyword is now required between relations and their aliases (e.g., `FROM zips AS z`) – it was previously optional (this makes it consistent with projections);
* the type creation operators `date`, `interval`, `time`, `timestamp`, and `oid` are now normal functions and must now be written `date("1234-5-6")` rather than `date "1234-5-6"`;
* quotation of identifiers is now done with `\`` rather than `"` (and should be less necessary, as a keyword will be parsed as an identifier if the context isn’t ambiguous);
* quotation of strings is now done with `"` rather than `'`;
* character escapes are now `\\\\`, `\\\``, `\\"`, and `\\'` rather than `""` and `''`;
* character literals are new, quoted with `'`; and
* Unicode escapes are new, which look like `\u1234`.
