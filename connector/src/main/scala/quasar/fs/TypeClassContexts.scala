/** These traits are intended for the common situation where
 *  a lot of code is being written inside a particular context.
 *  For instance, all the [Query|Read|Write|Manage]File
 *  implementations will require an Applicative instance, and
 *  filesystem results are of type EitherT[F, FilesystemError, ?].
 *
 *  What these allow is the extrusion of all the boilerplate
 *  necessary to lift values between levels if those levels are
 *  treated entirely generically. The Either implicits are the
 *  clearest example. One may variously need to lift a value of
 *  type A into F[A], F[_ \/ A], or EitherT[F, _, A]. Done
 *  manually, each of these liftings requires its own distinct
 *  tedious and noisy syntax.
 *
 *  But types exist to relieve us of such drudgery.
